# Jira

## CLI Scope

Jira commands cover issues, Jira Product Discovery ideas, projects, Agile boards, sprints, comments, and attachments. Use the full command reference for exact flags:

- [aai-cli command reference](../aai-cli-command-reference.md#jira)
- [Auth matrix](../auth-matrix.md#atlassian-cloud)

## Jira Product Discovery

Product Discovery ideas are Jira issues in `product_discovery`-type projects, managed through the Jira platform REST API with the same site and credentials. `jira ideas` commands scope searches to Product Discovery projects and discover project-specific idea fields (for example Impact or Effort custom fields) via the create-meta endpoints. Set idea custom fields by passing `fields.customfield_*` entries in `--json`; discover their ids with `jira ideas fields PROJECT`. Votes, reactions, insights, and formula values are not exposed by Atlassian's public APIs.
