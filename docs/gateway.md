# Managed credential gateway

`aai-gateway` is a separate process for installations where the CLI user must not
receive provider API keys. Provider credentials are stored only by the gateway and are
injected into outbound requests after proxy-token and grant checks.

The gateway state file is encrypted with a separate 32-byte key file. Keep both files
on the gateway host and protect them with filesystem permissions. Put the gateway
behind an HTTPS reverse proxy before giving clients a remote URL.

## Grants

Each proxy token can be granted several remote profiles. A grant requires both an
allowed operation (or `allow_all_operations`) and an allowed HTTP method. Explicit
operation and method denies win. New grants allow nothing.

The gateway does not expose the CLI's generic `request` escape hatch. SMTP/IMAP,
CalDAV, and local Excel operations are not gateway transports in this version.

## Administration

Set `AAI_GATEWAY_URL` and `AAI_GATEWAY_ADMIN_TOKEN` for the administrative CLI:

```bash
aai-cli gateway profiles list
aai-cli gateway profiles create --json profile.json
aai-cli gateway tokens create --json token-grant.json
aai-cli gateway tokens update TOKEN_ID --json revoke.json
```

Provider profile reads report metadata and secret-presence flags only. A newly created
proxy token is returned once; store it in the CLI's encrypted local secret store.
