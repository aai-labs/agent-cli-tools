# aai-cli

`aai-cli` is a Rust command-line toolkit that gives agents and automation a consistent JSON interface to common work systems. It wraps provider APIs with predictable commands, JSON stdout, and structured JSON errors on stderr.

The goal is not to replace full SDKs. The goal is to make common agent tasks safe and scriptable without each agent learning every provider API.

Project features that are not provider services:

- Persistent profile inspection, editing, validation, and default-profile management.
- Local encrypted secrets using XChaCha20-Poly1305.
- Generic authenticated `request` commands for HTTP-backed services.

## Documentation

- [Command reference](docs/aai-cli-command-reference.md): implemented CLI commands, flags, pagination behavior, and agent usage notes.
- [Auth matrix](docs/auth-matrix.md): supported credential models and provider-specific auth notes.
- [API documentation snapshot](docs/README.md): local machine-readable specs and saved provider docs.
- [Token refresh notes](docs/token-refresh.md): OAuth token refresh behavior for supported REST profiles.
- [Apollo implementation notes](docs/apollo/api-client.md): Apollo-specific base URLs, auth, rate limits, and endpoint coverage.

## Quick Start

Install from the checked-out repository:

```bash
cargo install --path .
```

Build and test without installing:

```bash
cargo build
scripts/run-tests.sh safe
```

Run through Cargo:

```bash
cargo run -- --profile jira-work jira issues list
```

Run an installed binary:

```bash
aai-cli --profile github-work github issues list
```

All successful command output is JSON. Errors are JSON on stderr and include `code`, `service`, `operation`, `status`, and `details`. Successful service responses include `_aai.pagination` with pagination status and instructions.

## Configuration

Default config path:

```text
~/.config/aai-cli/config.toml
```

Override config and profile:

```bash
aai-cli --config local/e2e.config.toml --profile jira-work jira projects list
```

Equivalent env vars:

```bash
AAI_CONFIG=local/e2e.config.toml
AAI_PROFILE=jira-work
```

Profiles should reference secrets instead of embedding credentials:

```toml
[profiles.github-work]
provider = "github"
auth_type = "bearer_token"
token_secret = "github.token"
owner = "acme"
repo = "app"
```

Store secret values with:

```bash
printf '%s' "$GITHUB_TOKEN" | aai-cli --config local/e2e.config.toml secrets set github.token
```

Keep credentials and generated local configs under ignored `local/`; never commit them.

## Generic Authenticated Requests

Typed commands are preferred for common workflows. For reports and uncommon provider endpoints, HTTP-backed services expose an authenticated `request` escape hatch:

```bash
aai-cli --profile github-work github request get /repos/acme/app/issues --query state=closed
aai-cli --profile apollo-work apollo request get /users/api_profile
aai-cli --profile jira-work jira request post /rest/api/3/issue --allow-write --json -
```

Supported services are `jira`, `confluence`, `bitbucket`, `github`, `pipedrive`, `apollo`, and REST-backed `email` and `calendar` profiles. SMTP/IMAP and CalDAV profiles are intentionally excluded.

## Development

Common commands:

```bash
cargo build
cargo check --all-targets --all-features
cargo fmt --check
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
scripts/run-tests.sh safe
```

Live E2E tests are ignored by default and require local credentials:

```bash
AAI_E2E_CONFIG=./local/e2e.config.toml scripts/run-tests.sh live
```
